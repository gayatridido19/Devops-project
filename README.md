# Devops Basic Project 

Here’s a **basic DevOps project** setup for a Spring Boot Java application with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This is great for practicing version control, build automation, and continuous integration.

### ✅ Step-by-Step Project Setup

#### 1. **Project Structure**

```bash
devops-demo/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── ci.yml
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       └── java/
│           └── com/example/demo/

# 🚀 DevOps Demo Project (Java + Maven + GitHub Actions)

This is a basic DevOps demo project using **Java**, **Maven**, and **GitHub Actions** for CI.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/` - Java source code
- `pom.xml` - Maven configuration file
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- `README.md` - Project overview

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Maven
- GitHub Actions
- Git

## 🔧 How to Run the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
````

To run:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## 🚀 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

When you push code to GitHub, the pipeline will:

* Checkout code
* Set up Java
* Build the project
* Run tests

## 📄 CI Workflow File - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: Java CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean install
```

## ✅ How to Use

1. Clone the repo or create a new one.
2. Add your Java code.
3. Create the GitHub Actions workflow as shown.
4. Commit and push to GitHub.
5. GitHub will automatically trigger the CI pipeline.

Here's a professional `README.md` file for your GitHub repo: **`CICD`** — assuming it's a Spring Boot project using Docker and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. You can copy this into your repo.

# CI/CD Pipeline with Spring Boot, Docker, and GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Spring Boot application using Docker and automate the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- AWS (for deployment - optional)

## 📁 Project Structure

```

CICD/
├── .github/workflows/    # GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
├── Dockerfile            # Docker configuration to build image
├── target/               # Compiled JAR output
├── src/                  # Spring Boot source code
└── README.md             # Project documentation

````

## 🚀 Features

- Automates build and test steps using GitHub Actions
- Builds a Docker image from the Spring Boot app
- Pushes Docker image to Docker Hub (optional)
- Can be extended for AWS EC2 or ECS deployment

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven
- Docker
- GitHub account with Actions enabled
- Docker Hub account (optional for pushing images)

## 🐳 Docker Instructions

To build and run the Docker container:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t springboot-cicd-app .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 8080:8080 springboot-cicd-app
````

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow

Sample workflow: `.github/workflows/main.yml`

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy Spring Boot App

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      - name: Build with Maven
        run: mvn clean install

      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t springboot-cicd-app .

      # Add your Docker Hub login and push steps if required
```

Here’s a complete `README.md` file for your Spring Boot Java 17 project:

---

```markdown
# Spring Boot First Web Application

This is a simple web application built using **Spring Boot 2.7.18** and **Java 17**, based on the tutorial by [in28Minutes](https://github.com/in28minutes/).

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Java**: 17  
- **Spring Boot**: 2.7.18  
- **Maven**: for project management  
- **JSP / JSTL**: for server-side templating  
- **Spring Security**: for basic authentication  
- **WebJars**: for frontend libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery)

└── test/                           # Unit and integration tests

````

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

Make sure Java 17 and Maven are installed.

```bash
# Step 1: Clean and build the project
mvn clean install

# Step 2: Run the application
mvn spring-boot:run
````

## 📦 Maven Dependencies Overview

Key dependencies used in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency> spring-boot-starter-web </dependency>
<dependency> spring-boot-starter-security </dependency>
<dependency> javax.servlet:jstl </dependency>
<dependency> org.webjars:bootstrap </dependency>
<dependency> org.webjars:jquery </dependency>
<dependency> tomcat-embed-jasper </dependency>
<dependency> spring-boot-devtools </dependency>
<dependency> spring-boot-starter-test </dependency>
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* **JSP Limitations**: Embedded JSPs with Tomcat work but are discouraged in modern Spring Boot apps. Consider using **Thymeleaf** if you're planning future upgrades.
* **WebJars Versions**: Currently uses older Bootstrap and jQuery versions — feel free to upgrade as needed.
* **Spring Boot 3+**: Not compatible with JSP. For Java 17+, consider migrating to Spring Boot 3 and using Thymeleaf/Freemarker for templating.
